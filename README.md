2. Create a new branch for your changes:
    - Use prefixes to categorize branches
      - feature/
      - bugfix/
      - hotfix/
    - Use meaningful branch names (e.g., feature/add-login, bugfix/fix-crash)
```shell
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
3. Make your changes and commit them to the branch:
```shell
git commit -am "Add your commit message here"
```

6. Ensure the PR title and description are clear and concise, describing the purpose of your changes.
7. Respond to any feedback or comments on your PR promptly. Be prepared to make changes or address issues are requested.

## Code Review Guidelines
1. **Assign Buddy:** Each developer is assigned a buddy for code reviews. The buddy is responsible for reviewing and providing feedback on the other developer's code changes.
2. **Familiarize Yourself:** Before starting the code review, both the developer and the buddy should understand the context of the changes. This includes knowing the purpose of the code, its impact, and any relevant design decisions.
3. **Communication:** Effective communication is key. Both developers should communicate openly and respectfully throughout the review process. Discuss any concerns, questions, or suggestions.
4. **Timely Reviews:** Try to complete code reviews promptly to avoid delays in the development process. Set reasonable expectations for when code reviews will be completed
5. **Check for Bugs and Issues:** Reviewers should focus on finding bugs, logical errors, and potential issues in the code. Verify that the code performs as expected and handles edge cases.
6. **Coding Standards:** Ensure that the code follows the team's coding standards, style guidelines, and best practices. Consistency is important for readability and maintainability.
7. **Documentation:** Check if the code changes are adequately documented. This includes inline comments, README updates, and any changes to API documentation.
8. **Security:** Pay attention to potential security vulnerabilities, such as input validation, data sanitization, and authentication/authorization issues. Security is everyone's responsibility.
9. **Testing:** Review the testing approach. Verify that the code has appropriate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable. Discuss any missing test cases.
10. **Performance:** Assess the code for performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms. Discuss optimizations if needed.
11. **Feedback:** Be constructive in your feedback. Instead of just pointing out problems, provide suggestions for improvements. Discuss alternative solutions if applicable.
12. **Approval Process:** Both the developer and the buddy should agree on the code changes. If there are disagreements, discuss and reach a consensus.
13. **Code Ownership:** While the buddy system involves reviewing each other's code, it's important to maintain a sense of shared ownership and accountability for the project as a whole.
14. **Rotating Buddies:** Consider rotating buddies periodically to ensure knowledge sharing and diverse perspectives.
15. **Learning and Growth:** Use code reviews as an opportunity for learning. Share knowledge and mentor each other to improve coding skills.
16. **Escalation:** In case of unresolved disagreements, have a process for escalating issues to other teammates or instructor for resolution.
17. **Follow-Up:** After code changes are approved and merged, ensure that any follow-up tasks, bug fixes, or performance improvements are tracked and addressed.
18. **Documentation:** Document the code review process and any decisions made during the review for future reference.

By following these guidelines, you can establish an effective buddy system for code reviews that promotes collaboration, code quality, and knowledge sharing among team members.

# Development Environment Setup

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to setup up this environment:

## Step 1: Install Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is essential for managing source code. You can download and install Git from the official website:

- **For Windows:** Download the git Windows installer from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. npm (Node Package Manager) is the package manager for Node.js. You can install both Node.js and npm together by downloading the installer from the official Node.js website:

1. Visit [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   
## Step 3: Verify Your Setup

To verify that Git and Node.js are correctly installed, you can run the following commands:
```shell
git --version
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands should display the installed versions of Git, Node.js, and npm, respectively.

Your development environment is now set up with Git and Node.js. You can use Git to manage version control for your projects, and Node.js/npm to develop JavaScript-based applications.
